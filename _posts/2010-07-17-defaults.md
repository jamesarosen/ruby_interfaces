title: Consider No-Configuration Defaults

Searching through common implementations (in order of popularity on [Ruby Toolbox](http://ruby-toolbox.com/)) for one that is loaded will allow the client to use the interface library without manually specifying an implementation. For example:

    module MyInterface
      class <<self
        def adapter
          @adapter ||= autoload_adapter
        end
        
        def adapter=(adapter)
          @adapter = adapter
        end
        
        private
        
        def autoload_implementation
          if defined? Foo
            MyInterface::Adapters::Foo.new
          elsif defined? Bar
            MyInterface::Adapters::Bar.new
          else
            raise "Could not find an implementation for MyInterface. Please set MyInterface.adapter."
          end
        end
      end
    end
      

**CAUTION**: as Ryan Tomayko points out in the [Tilt README](http://github.com/rtomayko/tilt), this pattern can cause load problems with multi-threaded clients. If you offer no-config defaults, warn multi-threaded clients.
