## Installation

    $ gem install httpi

## Configuration

HTTPI provides an accessor for the *default* engine:

    # in Gemfile:
    config.gem 'curb' # or 'httpclient'
    config.gem 'httpi'

    # in an initializer:
    HTTPI::Adapter.use = :curb

    # later:
    client = HTTPI::Client.new

HTTPI also supports using a specific client instead of the default:

    client = HTTPI::Client.new :curb

You can set headers, a proxy, and authorization credentials for future requests like so:

    client.headers = { "Accept-Encoding" => "gzip" }
    client.proxy = "http://proxy.example.com"
    client.auth "username", "password"

## Usage

The `client` object above has `get` and `post` methods for making `GET` and `POST`
requests, respectively. Each will return an instance of `HTTPI::Response`, which has
`headers` (`Hash`), a `code` (`Fixnum`), and a `body` (`String`).

## TODO

The author, Daniel Harrington, has asked for help implementing the other basic HTTP methods,
more implementations, and SSL support.
