Writing an interface before there are several competing implementations can box future implementers into a corner and stifle innovation. Instead, wait for two or more implementation to reach at least a modicum of maturity (check [Ruby Toolbox](http://ruby-toolbox.com/) for implementations). Then, compare popular implementations and require only the most salient pieces in your interface library.
